# Radio Joke Generator

A web application built with Next.js that generates downloadable 40-second mixed audio files with synchronized text-to-speech and background music. Perfect for creating radio-style comedy content!

## Features

- **Server-Side Audio Processing**: Complete audio mixing handled server-side using FFmpeg
- **ElevenLabs TTS Integration**: Generate high-quality text-to-speech audio using ElevenLabs API
- **Perfect Synchronization**: Automatically calculates timing to ensure TTS ends at exactly 22.5 seconds
- **AI-Powered Radio Jokes**: Uses OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o to transform any text into hilarious radio jokes with punchy endings
- **Custom Voice**: Always uses your pre-configured custom ElevenLabs voice for consistent audio quality
- **Native iOS Sharing**: One-tap sharing to Messages, Mail, AirDrop, and more with native iOS share sheet
- **Typing Animation**: Engaging typing effect with example prompts
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for deployment with proper security

## Architecture

This application uses a **hybrid client-server architecture** optimized for serverless deployment:

- **Client-Side (Next.js React)**: Handles UI, user interactions, Web Audio API mixing, and native sharing
- **Server-Side (Next.js API Routes)**: Manages secure API calls to ElevenLabs and OpenAI, returns audio data
- **Audio Processing**: Client-side mixing using Web Audio API (no FFmpeg required)
- **Static Assets**: Audio files served through Next.js public directory
- **Serverless Compatible**: Uses `/tmp` directory for temporary files, no system dependencies required

## Requirements

1. **Node.js 18+**: Required for Next.js development and deployment
2. **ElevenLabs API Key**: You'll need an account and API key from [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
3. **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an account and API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) for the radio joke feature
4. **Audio File**: A `song.mp3` file placed in the `public/` directory
5. **Modern Web Browser**: Supports Web Audio API (all modern browsers)

### Why No FFmpeg?

This application uses **client-side audio mixing** with the Web Audio API instead of server-side FFmpeg processing. This approach offers several advantages:

- ‚úÖ **Serverless-friendly**: No system dependencies required
- ‚úÖ **Better performance**: No heavy server-side processing
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Offloads processing to the client
- ‚úÖ **Universal compatibility**: Works on any hosting platform

## How It Works

### User Workflow
1. **Enter text** in the textbox (with engaging typing effect showing examples)
2. **Click "Generate 40s Audio"** to create the mixed audio file
3. **Choose your action**:
   - **Share** - Opens native iOS share sheet (Messages, Mail, AirDrop, etc.)
   - **Download** - Traditional download to device storage

### Behind the Scenes
- AI transforms your text into a hilarious radio joke
- ElevenLabs generates high-quality TTS audio
- Web Audio API mixes TTS with background music
- Perfect timing ensures TTS ends at exactly 22.5 seconds
- 40-second professional WAV file ready for sharing

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**: Type the text you want to convert to speech
2. **Optional - Radio Joke**: Click "üéôÔ∏è Make Radio Joke" to transform your text into a funny 10-second radio joke with a punchy ending
3. **Generate TTS**: Click "Generate TTS" to create the audio using your custom voice
4. **Review Timing**: The app will show:
   - TTS duration
   - Calculated start delay
5. **Play**: Click "Play Synchronized Audio" to start both audio tracks

## Radio Joke Feature

The **üéôÔ∏è Make Radio Joke** button uses OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o to transform any text into a professional radio-style joke:

- **Input**: Any text or topic you want to make funny
- **Output**: A witty 10-second radio joke with a punchy ending
- **Style**: Clean, energetic, and radio-friendly format
- **Perfect for TTS**: Optimized for speech synthesis timing

### Example:
- **Input**: "I love pizza"
- **Output**: "You know you're obsessed with pizza when you consider pepperoni a vegetable... and honestly, I'm not arguing with that logic!"

## How Synchronization Works

The application uses a precise timing algorithm:

1. **Target End Time**: TTS must end at exactly 22.5 seconds
2. **Calculation**: `Start Delay = 22.5 seconds - TTS Duration`
3. **Playback**: 
   - Music starts immediately and plays to completion
   - TTS starts after the calculated delay
   - TTS ends at 22.5 seconds, music continues until it naturally ends

### Example Scenarios

- **TTS Duration: 5 seconds** ‚Üí TTS starts at 17.5 seconds
- **TTS Duration: 10 seconds** ‚Üí TTS starts at 12.5 seconds
- **TTS Duration: 25 seconds** ‚Üí TTS starts immediately (will be cut off at 22.5 seconds)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error generating TTS"** or **"ElevenLabs API key not configured on server"**
   - Ensure the `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your deployment
   - Check your API key is correct in the environment variables
   - Ensure you have credits in your ElevenLabs account
   - Try with shorter text

2. **"Error playing music file"**
   - Ensure `song.mp3` is in the `public/` directory
   - Check the file format is supported (MP3 recommended)
   - Clear browser cache

3. **"Error generating radio joke"** or **"OpenAI API key not configured on server"**
   - Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your deployment
   - Check your OpenAI API key is correct in the environment variables
   - Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
   - Make sure there's text in the input box to transform

4. **Build errors on Vercel**
   - Check that all environment variables are set
   - Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher
   - Check the build logs for specific error messages

5. **Audio not synchronized**
   - This is usually caused by browser audio policies
   - Try clicking the page before playing audio
   - Check browser console for errors

### Development Tips

- **Local API Testing**: Use `curl` or Postman to test API endpoints
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env.local` to git
- **Audio Files**: Keep audio files under 10MB for better performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on different browsers for audio support

## Security Notes

- **API Keys**: All API keys are stored securely in server-side environment variables and never exposed to the client
- **Zero Client-Side API Keys**: The client never handles or stores API keys - all external API calls are made server-side
- **CORS**: API endpoints are configured to accept requests from the same origin only
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data is stored in environment variables and never committed to version control
- **Client-Side Storage**: Only non-sensitive preferences are stored in localStorage

## Performance Optimizations

- **Audio Caching**: Audio files are cached with proper headers
- **API Timeouts**: Server-side API calls have 30-second timeout
- **Bundle Size**: Next.js automatically optimizes JavaScript bundles
- **Static Assets**: Audio files are served efficiently through Vercel CDN

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support (may require user interaction first)
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on mobile devices

## API Credits

This application uses both ElevenLabs and OpenAI APIs:
- **ElevenLabs**: Each TTS generation uses credits from your ElevenLabs account
- **OpenAI**: Each radio joke generation uses credits from your OpenAI account

Monitor your usage through your respective API dashboards.
